  <p><span class="subsubtitle">Research Philosophy:</span><br />

<p>Our group frequently identifies problems that have impact, and
works backward to identify or develop the set of tools required to
solve the problem.  Therefore we employ and develop computational
approaches in a variety of spaces, from DFT, time-domain DFT,
molecular dynamics, empirical interatomic potentials, and machine
learning.</p>

<br />

  <p><span class="subsubtitle">Our predictions that have been subsequently experimentally confirmed:</span><br />

<p>Our group has made many theoretical predictions that have been
subsequently observed in the laboratory.  We tend to publish our
predictions well before the experiments are performed, demonstrating
the truly predictive nature of our work. Among the key values of our
work is guiding lab researchers to materials and effects that they
would not otherwise discover on their own.</p>

<ul>
<li>In 2016, we predicted a fundamentally new fashion in which to
  induce a structural phase change: electrostatic
  gating. <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms10671"
  target="_blank">We predicted that 2D MoTe<sub>2</sub> will undergo a
  structural phase change from the semiconducting H phase to the
  semi-metallic T&rsquo; phase when sufficient electrical charge is
  added or removed.</a>  This is a totally distinct mechanism from
  ordinary means for phase changes, typically involving temperature
  changes.  This effect has been observed in a
  <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature24043.html"
  target="_blank">2017 report in Nature by the Zhang group at
  Berkeley</a>, and represents exciting potential for radically new
  types of electronic information storage devices with lower energy
  consumption.  There is also potential to reduce the subthreshold
  swing of conventional FETs with this mechanism to increase the
  energy efficiency of our electronic devices.</li>

<br />
<li>In
2015 <a href="http://www.nature.com/nmat/journal/v15/n1/full/nmat4447.html"
target="_blank">we reported multi-scale MD simulations of shocked
silica indicating that the high pressure stishovite phase crystallizes
on nanosecond timescales under conditions of shock compression
associated with meteor impact on Earth and laser-induced glass
damage.</a>  The stishovite phase of silica has been used as a marker
for meteor impact sites on Earth for decades. However, the kinetics of
the crystallization process might naively be expected to be quite slow
because glassy silica crystallizes on geological timescales at ambient
conditions.  We find that a combination of high temperatures and high
pressure coordination changes dramatically increases the
crystallization rate under shock compression, giving an effectively
fragile behavior to this glass along the shock
Hugoniot. <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms9191"
target="_blank">Experimental observation of nanosecond formation of
stishovite under shock compression was simultaneously reported by
researchers at SLAC in 2015 using the MEC endstation of LCLS.</a></li>

<br />
<li>In 2014, <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms5214"
target="_blank">we predicted that 2D MoTe<sub>2</sub> will undergo a
structural phase change from the semiconducting H phase to the
semi-metallic T&rsquo; phase under tensile strains of a few
percent.</a>  AFM-based experiments in
2016 <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.nanolett.5b03481"
target="_blank">reported such structural changes under tensile strains
with kinetic timescales of minutes</a>.  This is essentially
ferroelastic behavior that could be useful for strain sensing and MEMS
with hysteresis.</li>

<br />
<li>In 2012, <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jz3012436"
target="_blank">we predicted that many 2D materials including
MoS<sub>2</sub> and other TMDs exhibit piezoelectric effects of
magnitudes comparable to some bulk piezoelectrics like GaN.</a>  The
piezoelectricity of these 2D materials is in stark contrast to the
bulk 3D structures which do not exhibit the effect.  These predictions
were observed in the lab in MoS<sub>2</sub> in 2014 with reports
in <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v514/n7523/full/nature13792.html"
target="_blank">Nature</a>
and <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/nnano.2014.309"
target="_blank">Nature Nanotechnology</a> and in other materials
since.  Our recent data mining work suggests there
are <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b05229"
target="_blank">hundreds of single layer piezoelectric materials</a>,
constituting an entirely new class of piezoelectric materials.
Practical strain sensing devices with 2D materials are starting to be
reported in the literature.</li>

<br />
<li>In
  2010, <a href="http://www.nature.com/nchem/journal/v2/n11/full/nchem.827.html"
  target="_blank">we predicted (with Nir Goldman at LLNL) that
  astrophysical ices (comet material: water plus small organic gas
  molecules) can produce chemical precursors to amino acids under high
  pressure shock compression and subsequent release back to
  atmospheric conditions.</a>  The production of several amino acids
  including glycine were
  <a href="http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v6/n12/full/ngeo1930.html"
  target="_blank"> subsequently observed in shock compression experiments on
  astrophysical ices in 2015</a>.  This remarkable discovery suggests
  that the building blocks for life are far more robust that one might
  expect, and may be produced by microscopic particle impacts on
  comets in space and via comet impacts on planets. The
  <a href="http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/5/e1600285 " target="_blank">amino
  acid glycene was observed in the coma of
  67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko</a>. Our calculations were made possible by
  a <a href="http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.90.235503"
  target="_blank">multi-scale modeling method</a> we developed to
  model shock compression in 2003.</li>

<br />
<li>In 2007-2008 before coming to Stanford, Evan
Reed <a href="http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.014302"
target="_blank">predicted that the atomically sharp interfaces between
piezoelectric materials in GaN/AlN superlattice structures can provide
unprecedented short time resolution of the highest frequency strain
waves in materials, with wavelengths approaching atomic scales.</a>
We expected that THz frequency radiation would be emitted as the wave
propagates over the interface, detectable nearby the material.
All-optical detection of several hundred GHz acoustic wave packets was
demonstrated in
a <a href="http://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/v5/n4/full/nphys1219.html"
target="_blank">2009 Nature Physics paper</a> by Mike Armstrong et
al. at LLNL.  This represents the highest time resolution strain
gauge, with response times faster than electronic devices can
resolve.</li>

<br />
<li>In
  a <a href="http://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/v4/n1/full/nphys806.html"
  target="_blank">2007 Nature Physics article</a>, Evan Reed and LLNL
  colleagues performed the first atomic-scale simulation of the
  detonation of an explosive, liquid nitromethane.  At that time, that
  states of matter present in the detonation were unknown, with
  speculation ranging from atomic plasmas to metallic condensed
  phases.  We discovered the material consists of short lived
  molecular species that exhibit a transient weakly electronically
  conducting behind the shock front.
  Later <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/ja808196e"
  target="_blank">simulations of TATB</a>
  and <a href="http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.038301"
  target="_blank">hydrazoic acid</a> shed light on the microscopic
  origins of vast sensitivity differences between these three
  materials.  Polymerization of TATB upon reaction significantly
  reduces diffusion and the kinetics of the decomposition, providing
  much longer reaction zones and less shock sensitivity than other
  materials.  These calculations were enabled by
  the <a href="http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.90.235503"
  target="_blank">Multi-Scale Shock Technique (MSST)</a> that was
  initially developed by us 2003 and developed over the years through
  2012.</li>

<br />
<li>In 2003 while at MIT, Evan
Reed <a href="http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.91.133901"
target="_blank">predicted that the familiar Doppler effect can be
reversed when light reflects from a moving boundary within a photonic
crystal</a> or spatially periodic medium, e.g. a shock compression
wave. This effect
was <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/302/5650/1537.long"
target="_blank">later reported</a> in electrically-driven shock waves
through a periodic RF transmission line.</li>

<br />
<li>In 2003 while at MIT, Evan
Reed <a href="http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.90.203904"
target="_blank">predicted the frequency of light can be changed by
tens of percent under certain conditions when it becomes trapped at
the front of a shock wave in photonic crystal.</a>  This mechanism is
an adiabatic frequency shift in a time dependent photonic structure,
rather than the usual nonlinear dielectric response mechanisms for
frequency conversion.  Adiabatic frequency shifting
was <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/nphoton.2007.72"
target="_blank">subsequently reported in tunable high Q cavities</a>
in 2010.</li>

  <p><span class="subsubtitle">Methodological Advances:</span><br />

<p>When necessary, our group has advanced the technology for computing
the properties of materials.  One fashion we do this is to clearly
describe in our publications how we employ existing tools to compute
something that has not been previously computed.  In other instances,
we have developed new algorithms and software in spaces including
molecular dynamics, machine learning applications to materials,
time-domain DFT with plane waves, and others. Selected examples include:</p>

<ul>
<li>We have advanced the employment of statistical or machine learning
to materials problems, with applications
in <a href="http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2016/ee/c6ee02697d"
target="_blank">materials search for battery technologies</a> and
for <a href="http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2017/sc/c7sc01052d"
target="_blank">automated construction of fast chemical kinetics Monte
Carlo methods from molecular dynamics simulations of complex
chemistry.</a></li>

<br/>
<li>
In 2017
we <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2053-1583/aa528e"
target="_blank">quantified potential advantages of a technique for
computing van der Waals interactions between layered materials using
an electromagnetic Lifshitz approach</a>, which is orders of magnitude
faster than state-of-the-art (ACFDT) calculations.
</li>

<br />
<li>In 2016 we developed a technique for computing the phase diagram
of an electrostatically gated 2D material, described in the supporting
information
of <a href="http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2016/160212/ncomms10671/full/ncomms10671.html"
target="_blank">our work on electrostatically gated
MoTe<sub>2</sub></a>.  This method circumvents the problem of
ill-defined total energies for charged periodic systems. 
</li>

<br/>
<li>In <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nn204198g"
target="_blank">2012</a>
and <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jz3012436"
target="_blank">2013</a>, we described methods for computing a
spectrum of piezoelectric coefficients for 2d materials. 
</li>


<br />
<li>In 2003 we initially developed a technique for enabling molecular
dynamics simulations of shocked materials with more accurate but
expensive quantum mechanical methods like
DFT.  <a href="http://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/fix_msst.html"
target="_blank">The Multi-Scale Shock Technique (MSST) is available in
the public distribution of the LAMMPS MD code.</a>  Also available in
the LAMMPS MD code
is <a href="http://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/fix_qbmsst.html"
target="_blank">an extension to semi-classically treat the quantum
mechanical nature of the nuclei (QBMSST)</a> which we found can have
significant impact on the temperatures and states of matter along the
shock Hugoniot.</li>
