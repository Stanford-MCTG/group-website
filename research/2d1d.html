 Layered materials have vast potential in applications, both in the
 bulk form and in a single layer. Bulk layered materials have been
 widely used for various technologies, for example in energy storage;
 most commercial Li-ion batteries today use layered materials such as
 graphite or layered metal oxides to store lithium. In a single layer
 form, they provide advantages such as maximum mechanical flexibility
 and optical transparency. Applications in nanoscale devices are
 numerous, and atomically thin transistors and resonators have been
 demonstrated. Even though there is a lot of research interest in
 layered two-dimensional materials, only a few of them are being
 studied. Graphene, BN, transition metal dichalcogenides and some
 others like phosphorene dominate the research on 2D materials.

<p>
 In this work, we use data-mining to screen almost 60,000 materials
 from the Materias Project database to identify discover 1173 2D
 layered materials, 487 1D materials, 98 lattice-commensurate
 heterostructures and 325 materials with piezoelectric monolayers. To
 do this, we developed a novel algorithm that can determine the
 dimensionalisy of the strongly bonded subunits in the crystal. We
 find bonds between atoms by comparing interatomic distances between
 all pairs of atoms in a unit cell with the sum of their bond
 radii. If the distances are smaller than the sum of bond radii +
 tolerance of 0.45 angstroms (to account for bond length variability),
 we consider the pair bonded. We find all connected clusters of atoms
 in the unit cell, and do the same for a 2x2x2 supercell of the unit
 cell. Now, we count the number of atoms in the connected clusters in
 the original unit cell and the 2x2x2 supercell. If the connected
 cluster is two-dimensional, the number of atoms in a cluster would
 have increased to 4 times the number in the original unit cell,
 because the size of a two-dimensional object scales as length^2.
</p>
<p>
 Using this algorithm, we identified 1173 2D weakly bonded solids and
 487 1D weakly bonded solids with unique chemical formulas, consisting
 of 23 distinct chemical families of 2D weakly bonded solids and eight
 chemical families of 1D weakly bonded solids. While layered materials
 have received considerable attention, much less was known about bulk
 inorganic crystals that consist of weakly bonded one-dimensional
 chains, or molecular wires. Less than 20 such materials were found in
 literature, and this work is the first to uncover a variety of 1D
 weakly bonded solids. The majority of weakly bonded solids identified
 in this work come from experimentally reported crystals composed of
 stacks of 2D layers or 1D chains of bonded atoms.
</p>
<p>
We also identify 98 weakly bonded lattice-commensurate
 heterostructures, i.e. materials with weakly bonded adjacent units
 with dissimilar properties. There has been much activity on
 assembling layers of different materials to make van der Waals
 heterostructures with new material properties3,4. However, the
 fabrication of such heterostructures present a significant
 experimental challenge. The materials identified in our work have the
 substantial manufacturing advantage of being amenable to growth using
 more conventional and scalable methods.
</p>
<p>
We also present data on the band gaps of the 2D and 1D materials, as
 well as the point groups. Crystal symmetries of bulk and monolayer 2D
 materials can be different for many layered materials, and the
 physical properties affected by them are also different. For example,
 TMDs in the 2H phase with inversion symmetry in the bulk form are not
 piezoelectric, but single layers of TMDs are piezoelectric. We
 developed a method to calculate monolayer point group symmetries from
 AA-stacking of the monolayers. Combining this with the band gap data,
 we identify 2D piezoelectric material candidates from point group symmetries.
