        Brandi Ransom, from Spring, Texas, is pursuing a PhD in
        materials science and engineering at Stanford School of
        Engineering. Prior to Grad School, at Rice University, she
        earned bachelor’s degrees in materials science and
        nanoengineering and German studies while competing as a NCAA
        Division I Track & Field athlete. Needless to say, she has
        exceptional time-management. She was originally trained as an
        experimentalist specifically in 2D material growth and solar
        cell assembly, however, the hype of hard drives and softwares
        enticed her over to the ergonomically unfavorable computation
        side of materials engineering. It started off small, an
        optimization of polymer extrusion based in excel, then
        a python package she adapted to predict tumor growth, and she
        was knee deep when she reached her senior project on
        data-driven development of a new super alloy. Because of these
        exceptional experiences that have trained her to be a master
        in synergizing machine learning and modeling with general
        science, she aids the Reed group in identifying new materials
        for solid Lithium electrolytes. Outside of her main work, her
        subsequent acceptance into the pioneer cohort of the
        Knight-Henessey Scholars will also allow her to pursue her
        passion of optimizing fiber manufacturing processes.

        She also enjoys baking the best darn-tootin' cookies you will ever taste and eat, and hydrating.

        Brandi decided to be a Materials Scientist when she was 11 years old, and that 11 year old is very proud of the woman she has grown into.          </div>
